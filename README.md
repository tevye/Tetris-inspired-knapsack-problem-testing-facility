# Tetris-inspired-knapsack-problem-testing-facility
Design of a Tetris-inspired, gamified knapsack algorithm testing facility.

## Motivation
The knapsack problem (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)) is accessible. Its description relates to a common idea to which many people can relate. On the other hand, with the unbounded form proven to be NP-Complete; study of the problem (and algorithmic improvements in estimating or solving) different forms the problem offers a rich vein of intellectual challenge to explore.

More specifically, I've been looking for something interesting to do with the $300 credit you get when you sign up for a [Google Cloud Platform free trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/signup/tos). This may well be it.
