## User-defined test sets

A user-defined test set consists of the following:

- The height and width of the container
- A set of test pieces (values and grid pattern)
- The optimal solution value

The above image shows a trivial test set with a 5 x 5 container and an optimal value of 42. It's a useful training set because the optimal solution is only achieved by foregoing selection of the highest-value piece.
